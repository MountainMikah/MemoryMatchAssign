# MemoryMatchAssign

Used for inspiration
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-memory-pair-game-using-react-native/

Used Dependencies: FlipCard, Vibration
Special Note for imgSrc, that contains my own images used for the game 
Stuggled with the matching logic so game is not actually fully functional which is a personal fault of mine

Also My bad for not having multiple commits, kind of foccused more on development than having version, so hopefully only having one commit will not detract form my mark.
My time was not spent very evenly, getting caught up in other assignments so this project does not have as much time dedicated to it as it should have.
Sometimes give this class less attention than what is needed because iof its status as an elective.

Hopefully I don't fail the class  :P)
